## What is LunaDesk?

LunaDesk helps teams work better in a hybrid working environment.

The core concept of the app is for employees to share which days they're working in the office, and which days they're working from home. We can't stop your co-workers eating your secret desk biscuits when you're not in the office, but we do make it easier to allow for better time management and to make for a more cohesive working environment.

## LET ME AT IT!

You're eager! A link to the original version submitted for the Supabase Hackathon is available here: https://lunadesk-freeze.netlify.app/, though perhaps you'd like to finish reading this readme first? Or don't, I'm a readme not your boss.

Alternatively, a link to the site which you can use to register for Early Access to our Closed Beta is availble here: https://lunadesk.co

## How is LunaDesk built?

LunaDesk, originally named WorkFrom, was built by Josh Cawthorne as an entry for the Supabase Hackathon. This project was created using **NextJS** with **Supabase Auth, Storage and Database**. It also utilised libraries including (but not limited to) Framer Motion, easy-peasy, styled-components and recharts.

WorkFrom went on to win "Best Overall Project" at the Supabase hackathon.

The LunaDesk team are currently hard at work on building a fully fleshed out Version One release, ready for launch later 2021.

## How can I run LunaDesk on my local machine?

You can't. Sorry. We have private keys that're needed to connect the code to relevant services. You're more than welcome to explore our codebase to see how it's built, though.

For your convenience, you can use the following site to view the project live instead. Nifty, huh?
